## **Types of SQL queries**

Before writing commands, let's figure out what types of queries there are in SQL. There are four of them - **DDL**, **DML**, **DCL** and **TCL**. Each of them performs certain actions - let's look at each category in more detail.

**DDL**, or **data definition language**, is needed to define data. These queries allow you to configure a database - create it from scratch and write its structure.

Examples of DDL queries: **CREATE**, **DROP**, **RENAME**, **ALTER**.

**DML**, or **data manipulation language**, is needed to manage data in tables. These queries help add, update, delete and select data.

Examples of DML queries: **SELECT**, **UPDATE**, **DELETE**, **INSERT**.

**DCL**, or **data control language**, is needed to grant or revoke access rights for users.

Examples of DCL queries: **GRANT**, **REVOKE**, **DENY**.

**TCL**, or **transaction control language**, is needed to manage transactions. These can be queries related to committing or rolling back changes to the database.

Examples of TCL queries: **COMMIT**, **ROLLBACK**, **BEGIN**.

It seems simple — only four types of queries, even less than tenses in the English language

Now let's move on to how SQL queries are composed and what elements they consist of.

## **What does the structure of an SQL query look like**

Here is an example of a classic SQL query, which consists of six of the most popular operators: two of them are mandatory, and the other four are used according to circumstances. Together they look like this:

- **SELECT** — selects individual columns or the entire table (mandatory);
- **FROM** — from which table to get data (mandatory);
- **WHERE** — the condition by which SQL selects data;
- **GROUP** **BY** — the column by which we will group the data;
- **HAVING** — the condition by which the grouped data will be filtered;
- **ORDER** **BY** — the column by which the data will be sorted;

Let's analyze each part of this query in order.

### **SELECT**

Any command must begin with a keyword — or an action that should occur. For example, select a row, insert a new one, change an old one, or delete the entire table.

One of such keywords is SELECT. It selects individual columns or the entire table in order to then pass the data to other queries for processing.

As an example, let's select the Name and Age columns from the Clients table:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, Age) FROM Clients
```

The output will be all the rows of the table that belong to the Name and Age columns.

### **FROM**

This part is placed after SELECT and is needed to specify which table or data source the information comes from. Here we write the name of the table we want to work with.

For example, earlier we have already selected data from the Clients table:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, Age) FROM Clients
```

In SQL, everything is built on tables. Therefore, if you need to get data from another place, we specify another table.

### **WHERE**

If you need to filter the data, we use the word WHERE. After it, we specify the condition that the rows must satisfy so that they are included in the query result.

For example, this query will return all rows from the table where the Age values ​​are greater than 20:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, Age) FROM Clients WHERE Age > 20
```

### **GROUP BY**

This operator helps us group data by specific columns. As a result, we get a new table based on the selected data.

For example, let's group the result of the previous query by city:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, Age) FROM Clients WHERE Age > 20 GROUP BY City
```

The query will return clients over 20 years old and group them by city. The main thing is that the City column is present in the table.

### **HAVING**

It is needed to collect groups according to certain conditions. It is usually used in combination with GROUP BY, and its functionality is similar to WHERE.

For example, let's specify that only clients with an order amount of 1000 rubles or more should be added to groups:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, PaymentAmount, Age) FROM Clients WHERE Age > 20 GROUP BY City HAVING PaymentAmount > 1000
```

Since our query is growing, we will put each part of it on a new line - so as not to get confused. This will not affect the correctness of the query, but it will become much easier to read.

### **ORDER BY**

Allows you to sort the received lines in ascending or descending order. Works with both numbers and symbols. As a parameter, you need to specify the column by which you want to sort.

Let's say we want to sort clients by age, from youngest to oldest, we add the ORDER BY Age command:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, PaymentAmount, Age) FROM Clients WHERE Age > 20 GROUP BY City HAVING PaymentAmount > 1000 ORDER BY Age
```

And to sort in descending order, we simply add the word DESC:

```MySQL
SELECT (Name, PaymentAmount, Age) FROM Clients WHERE Age >20 GROUP BY City HAVING PaymentAmount > 1000 ORDER BY Age DESC
```

In addition to these six operators, there are a lot of additional ones, such as VIEW, UNION, LIKE. They are unique for each query and are used depending on the situation. Of course, we won’t have time to cover everything in this article — if you need a complete list, you can take a look at this [SQL cheat sheet](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_ref_keywords.asp).

## **SQL query examples: creating the first database**

We’ve figured out the query structure, it’s time to create tables. As an example, we’ll fill a database with cats living in different cities of Russia.

### **CREATE DATABASE**

First, we create a database. This is done using the CREATE DATABASE command:

```MySQL
CREATE DATABASE CatsCatsCats;
```

There is nothing inside yet. But that's for now.

### **CREATE TABLE**

The query creates a table in the database. In general, the command looks like this:

```MySQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, column3 datatype );
```

To set your own table parameters, in place of table_name we write the name, and in brackets we indicate the names of the columns and the types of data they will contain.

There are many data types in SQL. Here are examples of the most popular:

- INT — integer;
- DATETIME — date;
- VARCHAR — string;
- FLOAT — decimal number.

Our table uses two types: strings (VARCHAR) and integers (INT):

```MySQL
CREATE TABLE CatsAndOwners ( CatID int(6) NOT NULL, CatName varchar(255) NOT NULL, CatAge int(6) NOT NULL, CatColor varchar(255) NOT NULL, CatOwnerName varchar(255) NOT NULL );

```

In the example above, we added five columns: the unique cat number CatID, its name CatName, age CatAge, color CatColor, and owner name CatOwnerName. We also specified that none of the fields should be empty — NOT NULL.

The numbers next to the data types indicate how many bits are allocated for the field. For example, varchar(255) means that the string can be from 0 to 255 bits — in terms of data volume, this roughly corresponds to the phrase “I love the SQL language.”

The table you created looks a bit empty for now. Read on to learn how to fill it with data and group it as you wish.

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|⁣|⁣|⁣|⁣|

### **ALTER TABLE**

If you suddenly forgot to add a column when creating a table, no problem. New columns can be added using the ALTER TABLE command. Let's add the city where the cat lives:

```MySQL
ALTER TABLE CatsAndOwners ADD City varchar(255);
```

In the query, we specify which table we want to make changes to, and then use the ADD keyword to add the column name and its data type.

Now the table looks like this:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|⁣|⁣|⁣|⁣|⁣|

In general, the capabilities of the ALTER TABLE command are a little wider than we have discussed in this example. It is designed not only for adding new columns, but also for deleting and editing existing ones. We will talk about this in more detail a little later, but for now, let's continue filling the table.

### **INSERT**

Allows you to add a new row to the table. To do this, you need to specify which columns you want to fill and pass values ​​for them using the VALUES command. Let's add some cats:

```MySQL
INSERT INTO CatsAndOwners(CatID, CatName, CatAge, CatColor, CatOwnerName, City)
VALUES (1, 'Murka', 3, 'Black', 'Dmitry', 'Moscow');

INSERT INTO CatsAndOwners(CatID, CatName, CatAge, CatColor, CatOwnerName, City)
VALUES (2, 'Bella', 7, 'White', 'Maxim', 'Saratov');

INSERT INTO CatsAndOwners(CatID, CatName, CatAge, CatColor, CatOwnerName, City)
VALUES (3, 'Simba', 5, 'Red', 'Ekaterina', 'Saint Petersburg');

INSERT INTO CatsAndOwners(CatID, CatName, CatAge, CatColor, CatOwnerName, City)
VALUES (4, 'Leo', 2, 'Striped', 'Alexander', 'Ekaterinburg');

INSERT INTO CatsAndOwners(CatID, CatName, CatAge, CatColor, CatOwnerName, City)
VALUES (5, 'Masya', 1, 'Grey', 'Anna', 'Moscow');
```

**Please note:** strings are specified in single quotes, and numbers - without them. And, unfortunately, you can't add multiple rows with one command.

Brilliant! The table finally has data:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Murka|3|Black|Dmitry|Moscow|
|2|Bella|7|White|Maxim|Saratov|
|3|Simba|5|Red|Ekaterina|Saint Petersburg|
|4|Leo|2|Striped|Alexander|Ekaterinburg|
|5|Masya|1|Gray|Anna|Moscow|

### **SELECT**

The query is needed to get data from the table. We have already managed to get acquainted with this command, - let's refresh our memory a little. Let's get a list of cats and their owners from the table:

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatOwnerName FROM CatsAndOwners;
```

Result:

|CatName|CatOwnerName|
|---|---|
|Murka|Dmitry|
|Bella|Maxim|
|Simba|Ekaterina|
|Leo|Alexander|
|Masya|Anna|

If you need to select all columns from a table, add the * symbol after the word SELECT. In this case, the output will be the entire table.

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM CatsAndOwners;
```
`

### **WHERE**

Needed to set conditions for filtering rows. For example, we can select only those with a CatAge value greater than 5:

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatAge FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE CatAge > 5
```

The result will be one row with two columns:

|CatName|CatAge|
|---|---|
|Bella|7|

### **AND, OR, BETWEEN**

The WHERE operator is interesting because you can specify conditions inside it — and several at once. This is done using the logical constructions AND, OR and BETWEEN.

AND is a logical AND. It means that both query conditions must be met at the same time. For example, the cat must be black AND live in Moscow.

```MySQL
SELECT CatName FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE CatColor = 'Black' AND City = 'Moscow'
```

Result:

|CatName|
|---|
|Murka|

OR is a logical OR. It means that either one condition or the other must be true. For example, a cat must be OR older than five years OR be black.

```MySQL
SELECT CatName FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE CatAge > 5 OR CatColor = 'Black'
````

Result:

|CatName|
|---|
|Murka|
|Bella|

**BETWEEN** is an operator that selects all elements within a given range. For example, you can request all cats between the ages of two and six.

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatAge FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE CatAge BETWEEN 2 AND 6
```

Result:

|CatName|CatAge|
|---|---|
|Murka|3|
|Simba|5|
|Leo|2|

All of the above operators can be used in one batch:

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatAge FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE CatAge BETWEEN 2 AND 8 AND (City = 'Saratov' OR City = 'Saint Petersburg') OR CatName = 'Murka'
```

Result:

|CatName|CatAge|
|---|---|
|Murka|3|
|Bella|7|
|Simba|5|

### **ORDER BY**

Sorts the retrieved rows in the specified column in descending or ascending order. For example, we can select all cats and sort them from oldest to youngest:

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatAge FROM CatsAndOwners ORDER BY CatAge DESC
```

Result:

|CatName|CatAge|
|---|---|
|Bella|7|
|Simba|5|
|Murka|3|
|Leo|2|
|Masya|1|

To sort the records in ascending order, you just need to remove the DESC parameter from the query:

```MySQL
SELECT CatName, CatAge FROM CatsAndOwners ORDER BY CatAge
```

Result:

|CatName|CatAge|
|---|---|
|Masya|1|
|Leo|2|
|Murka|3|
|Simba|5|
|Bella|7|

### **GROUP BY**

Selected rows can be grouped by columns. For example, we can see how many cats live in different cities.

```MySQL
SELECT City, COUNT(*) AS CatCount FROM CatsAndOwners GROUP BY City;
```

In this example, we used the aggregate function COUNT, which counted the number of rows in each group. We will return to aggregator functions later, but for now, enjoy the result:

|CatName|**CatCount**|
|---|---|
|Moscow|2|
|Saratov|1|
|Saint Petersburg|1|
|Ekaterinburg|1|

We also used the AS operator to set the name for the new column, which we used to collect the number of cats in different cities.

### **LIMIT**

The query allows you to limit the number of rows in the final output. For example, we can specify that only the first two rows from the table are output:

```MySQL
SELECT * FROM CatsAndOwners LIMIT 2;
```

Result:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Murka|3|Black|Dmitry|Moscow|
|2|Bella|7|White|Maxim|Saratov|

### **UPDATE**

Allows you to change the data in the table. Let's say Simba the cat went to a pet groomer and changed her fur color to purple. We reflect these changes in the table using the following code:

```MySQL
UPDATE CatsAndOwners SET CatColor = 'Purple' WHERE CatName = 'Simba';
```

It's simple: next to the UPDATE command, we write the name of the table that needs to be updated, then next to SET, we indicate which column we are changing and to what value, and at the end, we define a specific cell.

Result:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Murka|3|Black|Dmitry|Moscow|
|2|Bella|7|White|Maxim|Saratov|
|3|Simba|5|Purple|Ekaterina|Saint Petersburg|
|4|Leo|2|Striped|Alexander|Ekaterinburg|
|5|Masya|1|Gray|Anna|Moscow|

### **DELETE**

Deletes a row. For example, we can delete all cats that live in Saratov from the table:

```MySQL
DELETE FROM CatsAndOwners WHERE City = 'Saratov';
```

Result:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|CatOwnerName|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|Murka|3|Black|Dmitry|Moscow|
|3|Simba|5|Purple|Ekaterina|Saint Petersburg|
|4|Leo|2|Striped|Alexander|Ekaterinburg|
|5|Masya|1|Gray|Anna|Moscow|

### **DROP COLUMN**

Deletes a column. For example, you can delete the names of cat owners:

```MySQL
ALTER TABLE CatsAndOwners DROP COLUMN CatOwnerName;
```

Note that you must first apply the ALTER TABLE command. As we remember, it is designed to add, change, or delete columns in a table.

Result:

|**CatID**|CatName|CatAge|CatColor|**City**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|Murka|3|Black|Moscow|
|3|Simba|5|Purple|Saint Petersburg|
|4|Leo|2|Striped|Ekaterinburg|
|5|Masya|1|Gray|Mo

### **DROP TABLE**

If you no longer need a table, you can delete it. It's easy to do:

```MySQL
DROP TABLE CatsAndOwners;
```

Use the command at your own risk. We recommend saving the table first, just in case it comes in handy.

### **Aggregate Functions**

Aggregate functions are used to perform calculations with data in a table: count the number of rows, sum the values ​​in a column, find the average value, and so on.

There are five aggregate functions available in SQL:

- COUNT — count the number of rows;
- SUM — calculate the sum of the values ​​in a column;
- AVG — get the average value in a column;
- MIN — get the minimum value in a column;
- MAX — get the maximum value in a column.

Let's try to calculate the total age of all cats:

```MySQL
SELECT SUM(CatAge) AS TotalAge FROM CatsAndOwners;
```

Result:

|**TotalAge**CatName|
|---|
|11|

Now let's find the smallest age of a cat:

```MySQL
SELECT MIN(CatAge) AS MinAge FROM CatsAndOwners;
```

Result:

| **MinAge** |
| ---------- |
| 1 |

And now higher mathematics - let's calculate the average age of cats for each city:

```MySQL
SELECT City, AVG(CatAge) AS AverageAge FROM CatsAndOwners GROUP BY City;
```

Result:

| **City**         | **AverageAgeCatCount** |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Moscow           | 2                      |
| Saint Petersburg | 5                      |
| Yekaterinburg    | 2                      |
